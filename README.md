# Disclaimer
Due to massive Android fragmentation and permanently massive SDK changes, the project was closed. I'm not here to support and rebuild a FOSS software every few months if Google is changing the SDKs. I think it depends on a less secure and every time changing security model of Android. There is no concept at all. It feels like I'm a beta tester. I'm done with it.
